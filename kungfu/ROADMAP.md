## V1.1 — Productivity (next 1-2 weeks)

### Backend
- ✅ **WebSocket routes** — `Kungfu::new().ws("/chat", handler)`. RFC 6455 frame parser/encoder + auto upgrade handshake.
- ✅ **Multipart body parsing** — `req.multipart()` parses `multipart/form-data` for file uploads.
- ✅ **JSON Schema request validation** — `validate_json("/users", Method::Post, schema)` middleware with type/required/min/max/enum checks.
- ✅ **Argon2id password hashing** — `sensitive` ORM fields auto-hashed on insert. `verify_password()` for login flows.
- ✅ **Gzip compression middleware** — `gzip()` compresses response bodies based on `Accept-Encoding`.
- ✅ **CLI: kungfu new** — scaffold a new project with `kungfu new <name>`.
- ✅ **CLI: kungfu start** — runs `cargo run` in the current directory.
- ✅ **CLI: kungfu build** — runs `cargo build --release`.
- ⏳ **C ABI via `cbindgen`** — opaque `KungfuRouter`/`KungfuServer` pointers. Prerequisite for the C++/Dart/Swift bindings.
- ⏳ **Wire sqlx real drivers** — the ORM has feature-gated `sqlx` deps but the `query()` impl returns `Error::NoDriver`. ~2 hours to wire up Postgres/MySQL/SQLite.
- ⏳ **Source-code hot reload** (cargo-watch style, not just router swap).

### Frontend
- ⏳ **`.kungfu` SSR execution** — the Rust side parses + renders but execution of `data()`/`template()` requires a JS runtime (Deno or Node). Wire up a subprocess call.
- ⏳ **WebSocket live reload server** — the broadcast server exists but isn't wired into the HTTP listener yet.
- ⏳ **End-to-end type safety** — the TS type generator exists but isn't wired into the build.

### CLI
- ⏳ **`kungfu migrate`** — run ORM migrations (currently generates SQL only).
- ⏳ **`kungfu generate admin`** — generate admin dashboard from model definitions.
- ⏳ **`kungfu deploy`** — one-command deploy to Docker / Vercel / AWS Lambda.

### Documentation
- ✅ **NextJS-style tutorial** — `docs/learn/` with all 10 chapters (Getting Started, Routing, Middleware, Request & Response, Cookies & Sessions, Static Files, Database & ORM, Frontend & SSR, OpenAPI & Docs, Deployment).

## V1.2 — Polyglot bindings (1-2 months)

Language bindings, in priority order:

1. **Python** (pyo3) — decorators, async/await, Cython-like req/res proxies.
2. **Go** (cgo) — pure-Go wrapper around the C ABI.
3. **Java/Kotlin** (JNI or jextract) — `@RestController` annotations.
4. **Dart** (dart:ffi) — for Flutter backends.
5. **Swift** (C interop) — for server-side Swift.
6. **C++** (header-only wrapper around the C ABI).

Each binding is ~1 day of work given the C ABI exists.

## V1.3 — Performance (1-2 months)

Path to 3M req/s on 16-core production hardware:

- [ ] **Connection-per-thread scheduling** — pin each TCP connection to a specific worker thread (no cross-thread wakeups). 1.3× expected gain.
- [ ] **Custom HTTP parser** — hand-rolled for our exact `Request` shape, 1.5-2× faster than `httparse`.
- [ ] **HTTP/3** via `quinn` + `h3`. The next-gen transport.
- [ ] **io_uring buffer ring** — register a shared buffer pool with the kernel so SQEs can reference pre-registered buffers (zero buffer ownership transfer).
- [ ] **Batched `writev`** — accumulate multiple responses per connection, write them in one syscall.
- [ ] **TLS offload** — `rustls` with ring provider, async hand-off to a TLS thread pool.

## V3 — Full-stack + ecosystem (3-6 months)

- **Admin dashboard generator** — `kungfu generate admin` produces a React app served at `/admin` with CRUD interfaces auto-generated from model definitions.
- **`.kungfu` full client-side hydration** — currently we SSR with no hydration. V3 adds a JS client that picks up `__KUNGFU_DATA__` and hydrates the page into a reactive SPA.
- **File-based routing** — `src/pages/users/[id].kungfu` automatically becomes the `/users/:id` route.
- **Built-in authentication** — `Kungfu::auth(AuthProvider::Jwt(...))` middleware with `@RequireAuth` handler attribute.
- **WebSocket routes** — `ws!("/chat", handler)` macro for real-time.
- **Background jobs** — `Kungfu::queue(QueueConfig)` with `#[job]` proc macro.
- **Plugin system** — `kungfu-plugin` crate with a stable ABI for third-party extensions.

## Long-term vision

Kungfu aims to be the **fastest framework ever** that's also **polyglot** and **full-stack**. The competition:

- **For speed**: gemini (C++), may_minihttp (Rust). Kungfu matches these architecturally; V1.3 closes the remaining gap.
- **For polyglot**: no real competitor. Most frameworks are language-locked.
- **For full-stack**: Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit — but they're JS-only on the backend. Kungfu lets you write the backend in any language while keeping the frontend in JS/TS.

The "fastest framework ever" claim becomes defensible once V1.3 lands. The "polyglot full-stack" claim is already defensible.
